E-WISE
We are from TimSitu and want to deploy an application to reduce electronic waste (E-Waste)

In response to the escalating global issue of electronic waste (e-waste) accumulation and the lack of efficient disposal methods, our team, namely "TimSitu" presents the E-Wise management mobile application as a pioneering solution. This innovative approach addresses the dual challenges of inadequate user awareness about responsible e-waste disposal and the absence of a streamlined system for collection and recycling. E-Wise aligns its mission with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, specifically targeting Target 12.5. The aim is to substantially reduce waste generation by 2030 through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.

App Features
1. Store the e-waste to e-waste Bank by Pick Up : Users can dispose of their e-waste by utilizing a pick-up service provided by couriers, making it more convenient for them, especially if the e-waste bank is located at a considerable distance. Supported by Google Map API and FireBase
2. Find the nearest e-waste Bank to drop the e-waste : By finding the nearest e-waste bank provides with Google Map API, users can directly dispose of their e-waste at that location.
3. User can get benefit from e-waste management by earning some points : By disposing of electronic waste through the e-wise application, users will receive points that can be redeemed into e-money. This incentive encourages users to actively participate in electronic waste management.
4. User can get more educated by e-waste management information : Users can become educated about the environmental hazards of e-waste, proper e-waste management practices, and the benefits/creativity that can be derived from such e-waste with all the content data are stored and updated with FireBase.
